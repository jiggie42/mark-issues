# **M**acaroni **A**utomated **R**epositories **K**it Issues

The **M**acaroni **A**utomated **R**epositories **K**it is the Stack
of all softwares used by Macaroni to maintain and to generate `kits` together
with the tools used by Macaroni to convert Portage metadata to *anise* specs.

Submit issues here for all issues with the *tree* and with MARK stack.

Github permits referencing the issue from another repository using
<org/repo>#<num-issue> so if you submit PRs for open issues you can
use:

```
Bugs: macaroni-os/<repo>#<num-issue>
```

or

```
Closes: macaroni-os/<repo>#<num-issue>
```

The MARK-1 (naming inspired by the Iron Man Armors) doesn't include the stack to
generate binary repositories (*anise-build*, etc.) that continues to have the
repository *macaroni-funtoo* as the main issue tracker.
